    <p>Welcome and thank you for visiting my personal webpage, the purpose of which, is to let prospective employers know me a little bit better.
    </p>
    <p>I am a 23-year-old recent graduate of International Relations. A Bachelor’s Study taken at ISCSP in Lisbon by way of Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany, where I did an Erasmus year at the Friedrich-Alexander Universität.
    </p>
    <p>Presently I find myself on the Market in search of my first job opportunity after finishing College. Preferably one that will let me acquire real world experience to complement my academic training.
    </p>
  <p> I possess experience as an administrative clerk, 7 months’ work at a small adult education and job training Co-op, Rurambiente, CRL. The experience that I have acquired in this function coupled with the ease with which I use multiple software and my track record as a team player could prove useful in many fields, including but not limited to my area of expertise.   </p>
  <p> My German is of a fairly high level. I am also fluent in English, having used it extensively in Academic settings. Location wise, I am fully available to relocate if need be, both inside the country and abroad. </p>
  <p> On a more personal note I am a stickler for punctuality and have rarely missed a days’ work. I am a very hard-working individual and always hold myself to a very high standard.   </p>
  <p> For all the above reasons, I believe myself to be a good candidate, with the right profile to fill the opening to which I applied for. I would be a great addition to any workplace, for all that I have achieved in the past but especially because of my immense willingness to learn new things and improve. I understand it would be a challenge but I am confident that with my willpower and work ethic I can contribute to the success of any project, if I am given the chance. </p>
  <p> I hope my profile fits your needs and expectations and that you’ll consider my application. </p>
  <p> Best wishes,</p>
