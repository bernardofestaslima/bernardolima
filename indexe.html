  <p> If you are reading this Website it is likely you are a prospective employer.
     First of all let me welcome and thank you for visiting this page.
     I hope you'll enjoy and than you'll consider my application.
  </p>
  <p>I am a recently graduated 23 year old who is now searching for his first job opportunity after college..
    The area I studied, International Relations, does not present many opportunities at the moment, so please don’t find it odd if the position that I am applying to is outside my field of expertise.
    I have been applying to several positions, especially entry level ones.
  </p>
  <p>The only work experience I possess is as an administrative clerk, 7 months’ work at a small adult education and job training Co-op.
     I have also been looking for work outside this area as well, mainly openings that don´t require extensive experience.
     I believe I can be successful in many different situations because I am willing to learn and tend to do it quickly as I am a very hard-working man.
    Do not hesitate to give me an opportunity, you won’t regret it.
